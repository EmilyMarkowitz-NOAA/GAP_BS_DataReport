During the 2022 survey, walleye pollock were present at X out of 375 (%) EBS survey stations and X of 144 (%) survey stations in the NBS. In the EBS, walleye pollock were found in depths between 22 m and 183 m, and at bottom temperatures between -1.6°C and 8.4°C. In the NBS, walleye pollock were found in depths between 11 m and 78 m, and at bottom temperatures between -1.7°C and 11.4°C.
The estimated biomass of walleye pollock in the EBS was 4.2 million t (29% of the total biomass; Tables `r tab_majorspp_bio` and `r tab_wt`) and estimated abundance was 7.6 billion fish (Table `r tab_no`). Previously, in 2021, walleye pollock biomass was estimated to be 3 million t (25% of the total biomass; Table `r tab_majorspp_bio`) and estimated abundance was 5.9 billion fish [`r paste0(‘@’,ref_compareyr,”)`].
The estimated biomass of walleye pollock in the NBS was 394,585 t (12% of the total biomass; Tables `r tab_majorspp_bio` and `r tab_wt`) and estimated abundance was 694.5 million fish (Table `r tab_no`). Previously, in 2021, walleye pollock biomass was estimated to be 474,467 t (16% of the total biomass; Table `r tab_majorspp_bio`) and estimated abundance was 679.3 million fish [`r paste0(‘@’,ref_compareyr,”)`]. 


The fork lengths of walleye pollock measured during the 2022 EBS survey were between 4 and 93 cm (Fig. `r fig_sizecomp`). The fork lengths of walleye pollock measured during the 2022 NBS survey were between 5 and 86 cm (Fig. `r fig_sizecomp`).


In 2022, walleye pollock biomass in the EBS was concentrated in the middle domain, with additional clusters in the outer domain, to the north of the Alaska Peninsula (Fig. `r fig_dist`), and to the east of St. Matthew Island. Walleye pollock was relatively consistent throughout the NBS survey area, with a small area of relatively higher density in the Chirikov Basin just south of the Bering Strait.


Since 2002, the EBS shelf survey biomass estimate for walleye pollock has varied dramatically. The spatial distribution of walleye pollock was relatively consistent throughout the NBS survey area, with a small area of relatively higher density in the Chirikov Basin just south of the Bering Strait (Figs. `r fig_bt`). Spatial patterns of pollock distribution during the summer trawl survey have varied considerably in response to cold and warm stanzas (Figs. `r fig_bt` and `r fig_dist`). During the colder years (2006 to 2013; Figs. `r fig_bt`), the highest densities of pollock were observed along the outer half of the EBS shelf (> 70 m) and the lowest densities of pollock were along the inner half of the shelf, as well as throughout the NBS when it was first surveyed in 2010 (Fig. `r fig_dist`). Since 2014, and during the warm stanza from 2002 to 2005, pollock were more spread out across the shelf compared to cold years. In these instances, high catch densities sometimes reached into the inner domain close to Nunivak Island and up against the northern edge of the standard EBS shelf survey area (Fig. `r fig_dist`). These distribution patterns are consistent with shoreward and northward feeding migrations typical of pollock during the spring and summer [@RN904].


The vertical availability of pollock to the survey trawl depends on environmental factors and can be affected by bottom depth, light conditions, fish size, and fish density [@RN906; @RN907]. Pollock in the 20-35 cm size range (representing 2-3 year-olds) are generally absent or in low abundance from survey catch samples in both the EBS and NBS (Fig. `r fig_sizecomp`) because they typically occupy a position much higher in the water column where they are unavailable to the survey trawl [@RN907].
