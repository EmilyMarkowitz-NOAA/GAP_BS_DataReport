# Appendix

## Appendix A: Station and Catch Data

Appendix A contains station data by vessel for the 376 successfully completed standard survey stations in the EBS (eastern Bering Sea) and 144 successfully completed standard survey stations in the NBS (northern Bering Sea). In using the tables, the following should be noted:
   - 1. Time represents the nearest hour and minute at the start of the haul in Alaska DaylightTime (ADT)
   - 2. Haul numbers are not always sequential because unsatisfactory hauls were omitted.
   - 3. All Start and end longitudes and latitudes for each haul are displayed as degrees and decimal minutes.
   - 4. Net measured codes are as follows:Y = Net width was measured by net mensuration gear.N = Net width was estimated from a function of inverse scope (wire out) and net height.
   - 5. Catch weights are displayed in total kilograms.

## Appendix B: List of Taxa Encountered

Appendix B lists all fish and invertebrate taxa taken during the AFSCâ€™s eastern and northern Bering Sea bottom trawl survey.

## Appendix C: Population Estimates by Sex and Size Group for Principal Fish Species

Appendix C presents population estimates by sex and size group from the `r maxyr` `r NMFSReports::text_list(haul_cruises_maxyr$SRVY, " (", haul_cruises_maxyr$SRVY_long, ")")` surveys for principal fish species.
