# Appendix

## Appendix A: Station and catch data

Appendix A contains station data by vessel for the `r NMFSReports::text_list(paste0(haul_cruises_maxyr$stations_avail, " standard survey stations were successfully completed in the ",haul_cruises_maxyr$SRVY_long," (", haul_cruises_maxyr$SRVY, ")"))`. In using the tables, the following should be noted:

   - Time represents the nearest hour and minute at the start of the haul in Alaska Daylight Time (ADT)
   
   - Haul numbers are not always sequential because unsatisfactory hauls were omitted.
   
   - All Start and end longitudes and latitudes for each haul are displayed as degrees and decimal minutes.
   
   - Net measured codes are as follows:Y = Net width was measured by net mensuration gear.N = Net width was estimated from a function of inverse scope (wire out) and net height.
   
   - Catch weights are displayed in total kilograms.


**List of Tables**

`r NMFSReports::text_list(paste0("\n\n - Appendix A ", sapply(list_tables[grepl(x = names(list_tables), pattern = "tab_hauls_catch_")],"[[","header")), oxford = FALSE, sep = " ", sep_last = " ") `

## Appendix B: List of taxa encountered

Appendix B lists all fish and invertebrate taxa taken during the AFSCâ€™s `r NMFSReports::text_list(paste0(haul_cruises_maxyr$SRVY, " (", haul_cruises_maxyr$SRVY_long, ")"))` bottom trawl survey.

**List of Tables**

`r NMFSReports::text_list(paste0("\n\n - Appendix B ", sapply(list_tables[grepl(x = names(list_tables), pattern = "tab_taxa_encountered_")],"[[","header")), oxford = FALSE, sep = " ", sep_last = " ") `

## Appendix C: Population estimates by sex and size group for principal fish species

Appendix C presents population estimates by sex and size group from the `r maxyr` `r NMFSReports::text_list(paste0(haul_cruises_maxyr$SRVY, " (", haul_cruises_maxyr$SRVY_long, ")"))` surveys for principal fish species.

**List of Tables**
